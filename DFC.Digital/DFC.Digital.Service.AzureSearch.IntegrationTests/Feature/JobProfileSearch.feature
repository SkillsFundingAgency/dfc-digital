@JobProfile
Feature: List job profiles based upon relevance to the "search term" entered
[DFC-31] List job profiles based upon relevance to the "search term" entered
[DFC-31 - A1] Job profiles which possess a <Title> or an <AltTitle> which exactly matches the "search term" should be listed first in the list
	1. <Title> and <AltTitle> are equivalent in weighting. (i.e. if the term exactly matches either <Title> or <AltTitle> these are considered equivalent - see [A3])
	2. The <Title> and <AltTitle> should be unique (i.e. it doesn't make sense if the same <Title> or <AltTitle> is used across different profiles - although this isn't prohibited.)
[DFC-31 - A2] Job profiles which possess a <Title> or an <AltTitle> which contains the "search term" should be listed second in the list
[DFC-31 - A3] Job profiles which satisfy the same condition, to the same level, are not listed in any particular order

[DFC-164] I want to be able to see Job Profile/s in my search results
	[DFC-164 - A1] Job profiles which possess a <Title> which exactly matches the "search term" should be listed in the list
	[DFC-336] Bugfix - User uses invalid characters as search term should not see anything
	[DFC-349] Bugfix - User search by a term that contains more than 50 results

	[DFC-167] Navigate using the Next & Previous hyperlinks
	[DFC-167 - A1] The maximum number of results shown on a page should be limited to the <page limit> (i.e. 10)
Covered in UI - [DFC-167 - A2] Only display the "Next" pagination control if the last result is NOT shown on the page
Covered in UI - [DFC-167 - A3] Only display the "Previous" pagination control if the first result is NOT shown on the page
Covered in UI - [DFC-167 - A4] The "Next" pagination control design should match the prototype and contain the following elements: "Next " <current page number>+1 " of " <total page number>
Covered in UI - [DFC-167 - A5] The "Previous" pagination control design should match the prototype and contain the following elements: "Previous " <current page number>-1 " of " <total page number>
Covered in UI - [DFC-167 - A6] Clicking the "Next" pagination control should redirect the user to the next page of the search results
Covered in UI - [DFC-167 - A7] Clicking the "Previous" pagination control should redirect the user to the previous page of the search results

# Scenarios demonstrating the correct application of [DFC-167 - A1]
Scenario Outline: [DFC-167 - A1 - 1] The number of job profiles displayed equals the <TotalNumberOfResults> if the <TotalNumberOfResults> is less than or equal to the <page limit> (i.e. 10)
	Given there are '<NumberOfResults>' profiles which have a Title of '<SearchTerm>'
	When I search using the search term '<SearchTerm>'
	Then the number of job profiles shown on the page is less than or equal to '10'. (i.e. the page limit)
Examples: 
| SearchTerm     | NumberOfResults |
| DFC-167-A1-1-1 | 3               |
| DFC-167-A1-1-2 | 10              |

Scenario Outline: [DFC-167 - A1 - 2] The number of job profiles displayed equals the <page limit> if the <TotalNumberOfResults> is greater than the <page limit> (i.e. 10)
	Given there are '<NumberOfResults>' profiles which have a Title of '<SearchTerm>'
	When I search using the search term '<SearchTerm>' 
	Then the number of job profiles shown on the page is equal to '10'. (i.e. the page limit)
Examples: 
| SearchTerm     | NumberOfResults |
| DFC-167-A1-2-1 | 11              |
| DFC-167-A1-2-2 | 101             |
